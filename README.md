# Linear-Regression
The script uses the LinearRegression class from the linear_regression module to train a linear regression model on a dataset. 
The dataset can be either provided as a CSV file or randomly generated based on the provided arguments.

The script includes functionalities for:

1-Reading a dataset in CSV format using Pandas (optional).
2-Generating a random dataset with multiple features (optional).
3-Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
4-Training the linear regression model on the training set.
5-Logging the training progress by plotting the mean squared error loss over epochs.
6-Saving the model weights (optional).
7-Calculating and printing the accuracy of the model on both the training and test sets.
